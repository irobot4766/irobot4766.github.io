    <p> Brawl Stars is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplayer_online_battle_arena"
            title="_blank">multiplayer online battle arena</a> [2] game where <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamer" title="_blank">players</a> battle against other players
        or AI opponents in multiple game modes. Players can choose between several brawlers that they have
        unlocked, each with their unique offensive or defensive kit. As brawlers attack and do damage to
        enemy brawlers, they build up their special ability, called a "Super". Each brawler has their own
        "Super" ability, which can, for example, spawn a damage-dealing turret or a complete heal. Each
        brawler also has two unlockable (passive) abilities called "Star Powers", which can be found in
        "Brawl Boxes" (the game's version of a loot box), or inside the in-game shop once the brawler re
        aches their maximum power level. Furthermore each brawler also has one unlockable ability called
        a "Gadget". A brawler's gadget appear in Brawl Boxes and in the shop once that brawler reaches
        power level 7. These abilities are, once unlocked, usable 3 times per match and are activated by
        pressing a certain "Gadget button". Additional brawlers can be obtained through Brawl Boxes as well.
        In addition, it is possible to purchase "skins" in the shop, which may alter the appearance,
        animations or sounds of Brawlers.

    <h2> Game design </h2>

    <p>
        The game design was influenced by popular multiplayer games such as Overwatch and League of Legends. The team
        wanted to create such a game that was designed with mobile devices in mind first. According to Supercell's Frank
        Keienburg, "Our focus was on retaining a lot of depth while stripping away all the fluff."[5] Although the game
        contains some elements of the battle royale genre, these were implemented before the genre as a whole took off
        and the team did not set out to make a game with those elements.[6]

    <h2>How it changed</h2>
    <p>
        The game is notable for its long soft launch period during which virtually every aspect of the game changed.[7]
        Supercell officially announced the game via a livestream video on June 14, 2017.[8] It received an iOS soft
        launch in the Canada the following day.[9] The soft launch would last a total of 522 days, during which
        internally it was doubted whether or not the game would ever actually see a general release.[6][5] Initially the
        game was played in portrait mode and had players tapping on the screen, this was changed eventually to players
        using analog controls and playing in landscape mode.[6][5] Other changes include changing the UI, changing the
        metagame and transitioning the game from 2D to 3D.[5] Frank Keienburg attributes the difficult beta period to
        the developer working in a new genre where they "weren't sure how to interpret it's success."[6] The game
        soft-launched in Finland, Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Ireland, Singapore, Hong Kong, Macao and Malaysia for iOS on
        January 19, 2018, and on June 26, 2018, Android received early access to the game as a continuation of the soft
        launch.[10]

    <h2>Game Modes</h2>
    <p>
        Brawl Stars has a variety of different game modes (such as Gem Grab, Showdown etc.) that players can choose
        from, each one having a different objective. Players can invite friends to play with them up to the maximum
        team size of the game mode.[3][4]
